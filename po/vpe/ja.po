"     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include\n"

"     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\n"
"     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\n"

"     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\n"
"     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n"
"\n"
"     3.3. Description of Modifications.\n"
"     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\n"

"          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\n"
"          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\n"
"          distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the\n"
"          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will\n"
"          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after\n"
"          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\n"
"          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\n"
"          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\n"
"          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\n"
"          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered\n"
"          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n"
"\n"
"          (b) Contributor APIs.\n"
"          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\n"
"          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\n"
"          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\n"
"          also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n"
"\n"
"               (c)    Representations.\n"
"          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\n"
"          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\n"
"          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\n"
"          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\n"
"          this License.\n"
"\n"
"     3.5. Required Notices.\n"
"     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\n"
"     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\n"
"     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n"
"     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\n"
"     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)\n"
"     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\n"
"     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\n"
"     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\n"
"     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to\n"
"     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n"
"     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n"
"     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n"
"     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\n"
"     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\n"
"     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n"
"     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\n"
"     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\n"
"     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n"
"\n"
"     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n"
"     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n"
"     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n"
"     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\n"
"     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n"
"     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n"
"     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\n"
"     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\n"
"     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\n"
"     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\n"
"     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n"
"     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n"
"     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n"
"     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\n"
"     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\n"
"     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\n"
"     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n"
"     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n"
"     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n"
"     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\n"
"     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n"
"     terms You offer.\n"
"\n"
"     3.7. Larger Works.\n"
"     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\n"
"     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\n"
"     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\n"
"     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n"
"\n"
"4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n"
"\n"
"     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n"
"     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\n"
"     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n"
"     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n"
"     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\n"
"     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\n"
"     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\n"
"     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n"
"     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n"
"     understand it.\n"
"\n"
"5. Application of this License.\n"
"\n"
"     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n"
"     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n"
"\n"
"6. Versions of the License.\n"
"\n"
"     6.1. New Versions.\n"
"     Netscape Communications Corporation (\"Netscape\") may publish revised\n"
"     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version\n"
"     will be given a distinguishing version number.\n"
"\n"
"     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n"
"     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\n"
"     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\n"
"     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\n"
"     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one\n"
"     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to\n"
"     Covered Code created under this License.\n"
"\n"
"     6.3. Derivative Works.\n"
"     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\n"
"     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\n"
"     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\n"
"     the phrases \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\", \"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\",\n"
"     \"MPL\", \"NPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in "
"your\n"
"     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)\n"
"     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license\n"
"     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and\n"
"     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial\n"
"     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\n"
"     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\n"
"     this License.)\n"
"\n"
"7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n"

"\n"
"     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n"
"     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\n"

"     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\n"
"     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\n"
"     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\n"
"     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\n"

"\n"
"     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\n"

"     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\n"
"     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n"
"     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n"
"     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n"
"     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n"
"     license.\n"
"\n"

"     prior to termination shall survive termination.\n"

"     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\n"

"     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\n"
"     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\n"
"     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n"
"     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n"
"     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n"
"     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\n"
"     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n"
"     terms You offer.\n"
"\n"
"     3.7. Larger Works.\n"
"     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\n"
"     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\n"
"     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\n"
"     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n"
"\n"
"4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n"
"\n"
"     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n"
"     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\n"
"     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n"
"     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n"
"     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\n"
"     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\n"
"     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\n"
"     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n"
"     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n"
"     understand it.\n"
"\n"
"5. Application of this License.\n"
"\n"
"     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n"
"     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n"
"\n"
"6. Versions of the License.\n"
"\n"
"     6.1. New Versions.\n"
"     Netscape Communications Corporation (\"Netscape\") may publish revised\n"
"     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version\n"
"     will be given a distinguishing version number.\n"
"\n"
"     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n"
"     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\n"
"     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\n"
"     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\n"
"     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one\n"
"     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to\n"
"     Covered Code created under this License.\n"
"\n"
"     6.3. Derivative Works.\n"
"     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\n"
"     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\n"
"     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\n"
"     the phrases \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\", \"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\",\n"
"     \"MPL\", \"NPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in "
"your\n"
"     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)\n"
"     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license\n"
"     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and\n"
"     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial\n"
"     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\n"
"     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\n"
"     this License.)\n"
"\n"
"7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n"
"\n"
"     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n"
"     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n"
"     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\n"
"     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\n"
"     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\n"
"     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n"
"     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\n"
"     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\n"
"     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n"
"     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n"
"\n"
"8. TERMINATION.\n"
"\n"
"     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n"
"     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n"
"     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\n"
"     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\n"
"     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\n"
"     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n"
"     shall survive.\n"
"\n"
"     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n"
"     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\n"
"     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\n"
"     You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\")  alleging "
"that:\n"
"\n"
"     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n"
"     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n"
"     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\n"
"     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\n"
"     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\n"
"     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\n"
"     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\n"
"     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\n"
"     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\n"
"     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\n"
"     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\n"
"     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\n"
"     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\n"
"     the 60 day notice period specified above.\n"
"\n"
"     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\n"
"     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\n"
"     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\n"
"     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\n"
"     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n"
"     Participant.\n"
"\n"
"     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n"
"     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\n"
"     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\n"
"     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n"
"     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n"
"     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n"
"     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n"
"     license.\n"
"\n"
"     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\n"
"     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\n"
"     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\n"
"     prior to termination shall survive termination.\n"
"\n"
"9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n"
"\n"
"     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n"
"     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\n"
"     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\n"
"     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\n"
"     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\n"
"     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\n"
"     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n"
"     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n"
"     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n"
"     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\n"
"     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n"
"     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n"
"     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\n"
"     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n"
"\n"
"10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n"
"\n"
"     The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in\n"
"     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n"
"     software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such\n"
"     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\n"
"     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\n"
"     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\n"
"     rights set forth herein.\n"
"\n"
"11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n"
"\n"
"     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n"
"     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n"
"     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n"
"     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\n"
"     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\n"
"     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\n"
"     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,\n"
"     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United\n"
"     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\n"
"     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\n"
"     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\n"
"     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\n"
"     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\n"
"     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n"
"     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n"
"     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\n"
"     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\n"
"     License.\n"
"\n"
"12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n"
"\n"
"     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n"
"     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n"
"     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n"
"     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n"
"     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n"
"     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n"
"\n"
"13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n"
"\n"
"     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n"
"     \"Multiple-Licensed\".  \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial\n"
"     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\n"
